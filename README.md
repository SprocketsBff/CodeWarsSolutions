# CodeWarsSolutions

okay so I started this before I found out you have to push each KYU!!!!! OMG I'm almost a 4kyu, thats 100s of kyus to push. So yeah... I dont see me doing all of that 
just to prove I did some codewars. Sticking to only pushing projects on GIt from now on. Also figuring out how to delete repos....good times.
